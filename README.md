# LSTM-tradeSignalClassifier
Predicts profitable stock trade opportunities using LSTM on OHLCV data. Includes trade simulation, backtesting, and performance evaluation.


# LSTM-Based Stock Trade Signal Classifier

This project uses **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks to classify whether a stock price sequence leads to a **profitable trade** ("Trade") or **non-profitable** ("No Trade"). It combines deep learning with backtesting logic to generate actionable signals based on past price movement.

## Problem Statement

Given historical stock data (OHLCV), the model learns patterns that predict whether the next few days offer a good opportunity to enter a trade. This helps in:
- Reducing noise from day-to-day volatility
- Improving the Sharpe Ratio by filtering bad trades
- Making systematic trading decisions using ML

##  Project Features

-  **Sequence Modeling** using LSTM to learn time-based price patterns  
-  **Trade Simulation Logic** using rolling windows, stop-loss, and take-profit  
-  **Binary Classifier**: `1 = Trade`, `0 = No Trade`  
-  **Backtesting**: Visualizes trades and compares model vs. baseline  
-  **Performance Metrics**: Win rate, Sharpe Ratio, drawdown
